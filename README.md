Objectives:
"This project aims to analyze transaction data to identify key indicators of fraudulent behavior using Excel, Power Query, and Power BI. The goal is to support the banking industry in detecting high-risk patterns, understanding user behaviors, and building data-driven fraud prevention strategies."
 
Data Collection: (Kaggle)
For this project on Fraud Detection in Banking, a synthetic dataset with approximately 50,000 transaction records was used. The dataset was designed to simulate real-world banking scenarios and includes detailed attributes such as:
•	Transaction ID, User ID, Transaction Amount, Transaction Type, Timestamp
•	Device Type, Location, Merchant Category, Card Type, Risk Score
•	Failed_Transaction_Count_7d, Previous fraudulent Activity, Fraud Label, and more.
The dataset was downloaded from a public repository (Kaggle) titled “Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection”, which is commonly used for analytical practice.
The data was provided in CSV format and imported using:
Excel,power query and Power BI

Here are some key analytical questions based on your dataset:

1.What types of transactions are most frequently associated with fraud?

2.Are there patterns in fraud based on time (e.g., weekends, night transactions)?

3.Which users or accounts have the highest number of fraudulent activities?

4.Is there a relationship between transaction amount and fraud likelihood?

5.How do device type, location, and authentication method influence fraud risk?

6.What role does a highrisk score or failed transaction history play in identifying fraud?

Detect patterns and behaviors that indicate potential fraud.

•	Segment transactions and users into risk categories (High, Medium, Low).

•	Visualize fraud distribution across multiple factors like transaction type, location, and time.

•	Identify high-risk users for closer monitoring.

•	Provide actionable insights to support fraud prevention strategies.
